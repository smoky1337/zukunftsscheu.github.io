Hi, I'm Louis – a doctorate researcher at the German Institute for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) with a passion for exploring the intersection of research and application - especially AI.

To get the boring stuff out of the way :)

- M. Sc. Intelligent Systems (University of Bielefeld, Germany)
- M. Sc. Computer Science (University of Bologna, Italy)
- B. Sc. Cognitive Science (University of Osnabrück, Germany)


Now the more exciting stuff! This blog is my space to share what I’ve learned along the way – the best practices, the lessons from my worst mistakes, and everything in between. From research insights to practical tips, I aim to document my journey and hopefully provide value to anyone navigating AI, banging their head against obscure python issues, and being overwhelmed by what is actually possible today.

Thanks for stopping by – hope to see you again soon!
